    October 17, 2021


    We''ve encountered some
    small issues with progress. It appears there is more wreckage then previously
    thought, probably being pushed in by the last storm. This obstacle will likely
    add another week of work, which could allow greater risk of exposure.


    Due
    to the civil strife present in the city, more violent thugs have been intruding
    on the perimeter, the homeless population appears to be getting especially aggressive,
    possibly out of desperation.


    The intrusions are depleting the men''s munitions,
    which are very hard to replace currently. In order to secure supplies we have
    had to discreetly raid local stores.


    The lack of supplies combined with
    the recent disappearances in the lower levels have made our work far more difficult.
    We are attempting to speed up progress any way possible, and get out of the city
    ASAP.
